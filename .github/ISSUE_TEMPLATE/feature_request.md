**MSAL is the recommended auth library for use with the Microsoft identity platform**

No new features will be implemented on ADAL. The team's efforts are on improving (MSAL)[https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet], the next-gen auth library. MSAL's wiki contains a (migration guide)[https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Adal-to-Msal] from ADAL.

If you require a new feature, there's a good chance it has already been implemented in MSAL. If it isn't, please open an (issue)[https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/new/choose] on MSAL's GitHub repo to let us know the details.
